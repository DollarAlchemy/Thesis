        <h2>Selected Excerpt</h2>
        <blockquote>
            "Morphic fields underlie the organization of systems and provide a basis for telepathy-type interconnections between organisms. These fields are built up through repetition, which acts as a kind of memory. They challenge the mechanistic worldview that has dominated science for centuries."
